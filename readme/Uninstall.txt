UNINSTALLING:

Download the installer package here: <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/execriez/LabWarden/master/SupportFiles/NetworkStatusWarden-Uninstaller.pkg>

The uninstaller will uninstall the following files and directories:

  /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.github.execriez.networkstatuswarden.plist
  /usr/NetworkStatusWarden/

There's no need to reboot.

After the uninstall everything goes back to normal, and primary network status changes will not be tracked.
