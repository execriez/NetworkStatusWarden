UNINSTALLING:

Download the NetworkStatusWarden uninstaller package here:

   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/execriez/NetworkStatusWarden/master/SupportFiles/NetworkStatusWarden-Uninstaller.pkg

The uninstaller will remove the following files and directories:

   /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.github.execriez.networkstatuswarden.plist
   /usr/NetworkStatusWarden/

After the uninstall everything goes back to normal, and network up and down events will not be tracked.

There's no need to reboot.
